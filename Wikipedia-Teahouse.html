<p>Hi all, I love Wikipedia and use it daily, thank you all for your devoted work. I hope this is the right place for asking this. If not please refer me to the right one.</p>
<p>I have created a site (a type of search engine) that can help search geographical information and places from Wikipedia. It basically lets users choose an area and a subject and get results on a map. Like "art deco architecture" in New York.</p>
<p>I would like to find a way to let Wikipedia users know about it. Is there a way I can do that through Wikipedia?</p>

<dl><dd><a href="/w/index.php?title=User:Omryv&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Omryv (page does not exist)">Omryv</a> - this is a very cool app you created - thanks for creating and sharing. There are some interesting applications. Is there a way to filter the results so only lists are displayed, as one option? In other words, exclude any results that don't have the word list in it? Items like State Capitals, Presidential birthplaces/libraries, NFL Stadiums, locations of mass shootings, etc. - are all items that are interesting to see visualized on maps. Three quick fixes I'd recommend - 1) add a reset button, which would reset the searches and take users back to the start page - it wasn't easy to change the search once I did the first one or clicked on an example, 2) change the second sentence on <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://copernix.io/about/">https://copernix.io/about/</a> to "Ever been to a place which you didn't know anything about?" and 3) don't have the "To see places from Wikipedia..." prompt keep popping up - it may be better and less distracting to have it in a fixed location on the side, or perhaps allow users to click a checkbox to suppress its recurrence? I think posting this here was the right way to promote it - and once it's fine tuned people will may save the URL and maybe even share it on social media.

<dd><a href="/wiki/User:Timtempleton" title="User:Timtempleton">Timtempleton</a> - Thanks a lot for your advice. I have already implemented some of your suggestions.

To clear the search you can simply refresh the page or delete the text in the search bar. I will have a look at these projects you mentioned.

<p>Hello!

I already made use of the {{<a href="/wiki/Template:Request_edit" title="Template:Request edit">request edit</a>}} template however, with no response yet.

<dl><dd>Hello, <a href="/wiki/User:Robertgombos" title="User:Robertgombos">Robertgombos</a>. This doesn't entirely answer your question, but I would point out that it's not articles that are notable or not, but rather their subjects. The easiest way to save an article nominated for deletion because of notability concerns is simply to demonstrate that significant coverage of the topic exists by posting links to that coverage in the AfD discussion. Updates to the article itself can wait until the discussion is over. <a href="/wiki/User:Cordless_Larry" title="User:Cordless Larry">Cordless Larry</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Cordless_Larry" title="User talk:Cordless Larry">talk</a>) 19:05, 21 May 2018 (UTC)
<dl><dd>Thanks <a href="/wiki/User:Cordless_Larry" title="User:Cordless Larry">Larry</a> for your input. I proceeded To be honest I've never been very active in AfD debates and I don't know what's the standard procedure when one policy contradicts itself with another. <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:EDITATAFD" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:EDITATAFD">WP:EDITATAFD</a> encourages to improve the article during AfD, however my COI with that specific article prohibits it. And I really don't want to get involved in COI fights nor to beat a dead horse. :) <a href="/wiki/User:Robertgombos" title="User:Robertgombos">Robertgombos</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Robertgombos" title="User talk:Robertgombos">talk</a>) 20:12, 21 May 2018 (UTC)
<dl><dd><a href="/wiki/User:Robertgombos" title="User:Robertgombos">Robertgombos</a>, I'm an AfD veteran myself, and while improvements to an article at AfD bolstering notability are almost always welcome (any other improvements, with deletion pending, are premature), with COI involved I applaud your caution. Larry's advice as to how to handle it is good; COI or not, and however much I fall on the deletionist side of the spectrum, show me indepth coverage in reliable sources that I missed myself, and I change my vote. <a href="/wiki/User_talk:Ravenswing" title="User talk:Ravenswing"><b><span style="background:#7F00FF;color:#00FFFF"><i>Ravenswing</i></span></b></a> 22:29, 21 May 2018 (UTC)

<dd>COI editors are welcome to participate in AfD discussions as long as they are not hiding their COI. Entries at AfD do need to be based on policy. If lack of notability is the main reason for deletion, then presenting references in AfD that properly support notability is the best way to prevent deletion. Adding them to the article or talk page during AfD is not as effective, and adding them to the article as a COI editor would likely raise issues. <b><a href="/wiki/User:Jmcgnh" title="User:Jmcgnh"><span style="color:#2eb85c">— jmcgnh</span></a><sup><small><a href="/wiki/User_talk:Jmcgnh" title="User talk:Jmcgnh"><span style="color:#0eff1a">(talk)</span></a> <a href="/wiki/Special:Contributions/jmcgnh" title="Special:Contributions/jmcgnh"><span style="color:#196633">(contribs)</span></a></small></sup></b> 22:42, 21 May 2018 (UTC)

<dl><dd>Here is my friendly advice to you, <a href="/wiki/User:Robertgombos" title="User:Robertgombos">Robertgombos</a>, as a veteran of thousands of AfD debates. Be brief. Be concise.

<p>Hi, I am new to editing on Wikipedia, but I thought I'd share what I know about fragrances and essential oils. I assumed that it was good practice to create a 'user page', but hardly 3 minutes after creating a user page, and before I had a chance to even submit a first edit, my user page was marked for 'quick deletion'. I was somewhat surprised but I went ahead and created my first edit, but I am wondering now if I did the wrong thing by creating a user page? Should I wait to do this? Many thanks!

It is true that you are missing the appropriate template to allow you to submit the draft for review; but I would tell you before adding it that your draft is a long way from being in shape to submit. It is very promotional in its language and nature, and it seems like you are attempting to spread the word about the company and its products. The links you offer as sources mention Canetic Advisors tangentially, if at all. Please review the notability guidelines for organizations at <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:ORG" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:ORG">WP:ORG</a>, which any organization must meet in order to merit an article. In short, they ask for in depth coverage of the subject in independent <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:RS" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:RS">reliable sources</a>. Routine announcements, brief mentions, press releases, or anything similar to those things does not establish notability. If no one has chosen to write about this company in depth(on their own), it is probably <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:TOOSOON" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:TOOSOON">too soon for an article</a> about this company. Wikipedia cannot be used to generate notability or spread the word about a company, it must already be notable.</dd>
<dd>I would surmise that you represent Canetic Advisors; if you do, you will need to review the <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:COI" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:COI">conflict of interest policy</a> and also the <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:PAID" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:PAID">paid editing policy</a>; the latter is <b>required</b> if you are paid to edit here(such as an employee editing about their employer). <a href="/wiki/User:331dot" title="User:331dot">331dot</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:331dot" title="User talk:331dot">talk</a>) 00:35, 22 May 2018 (UTC)
<dl><dd>Hello, <a href="/w/index.php?title=User:TONYLAAD&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:TONYLAAD (page does not exist)">TONYLAAD</a>. I agree completely with 331dot above. There is no chance whatsoever that your draft will be approved in its current form. Your draft describes the company's founder as "a passionate entrepreneur and energy industry thought leader with over 25 years of renewables, clean-tech and start-up experience. Canetic has set out a mission to disrupt the impact investing ‘intelligence’ space." Let me be frank with you. Phrases like "passionate entrepreneur" and "thought leader" and "disrupt the blah blah space" are examples of the worst type of promotional corporatespeak baloney, devoid of any substantive content. There are many similar examples of promotional startup jargon in your draft. That kind of language violates one of our core content policies, the <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:NPOV" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:NPOV">neutral point of view</a>, and is utterly unacceptable in an encyclopedia article. So, your first step is to comply with our mandatory (non-negotiable) <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:PAID" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:PAID">paid editing disclosure</a>. Your second step is to find <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:RS" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:RS">reliable, independent sources</a> that devote significant coverage to this company. Then summarize what those sources say - no more and no less. Then, ruthlessly strip every single shred of promotional language from the draft, until it is the most boring and most rigorously factual thing that you have ever written. Once you have done all that, double check your work and remove any hint, trace or whiff of promotional language that remains. Finally, add this template to the top of your draft:</dd>

<p>Hi, I'd like to know about how to use <a href="/wiki/Template:Uw-npa1" title="Template:Uw-npa1">Template:Uw-npa1</a>. The text says: "Hello, I'm Example. I noticed that you made a comment that didn't seem very civil, so it has been removed. Wikipedia is built on collaboration, so it's one of our core principles to interact with one another in a polite and respectful manner. If you have any questions, you can leave me a message on my talk page. Thank you."</p>
<p>I know how to put the template on someone's talk page. But are there instructions or a guideline that explains under what circumstances I can remove another editor's comment (or portions thereof) on a talk page, because it "didn't seem very civil", as the template says? The actual case is here: <a href="/wiki/Talk:M%C3%BCnsterstra%C3%9Fe_(street_in_Dortmund)#Notability" title="Talk:Münsterstraße (street in Dortmund)">Talk:Münsterstraße_(street_in_Dortmund)#Notability</a>. It's not really terribly rude, I mean there's no swearing... but actually it's rude! There is an AfD discussion about the article, and I meant to politely suggest that people should direct any relevant notability comments there, while it's active, instead of to the talk page. The reply from <span class="plainlinks"><a class="external text" href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Otr500">Otr500</a></span> seems sarcastic, provocative, and, well, uncivil. "Thank you for your improper instructions", "you do not have the authority, unless you bought the rights from Wikipedia, to dictate that article content", "if you did purchase this article, I will apologize in advance and refrain from future edits"...</p>
<p>I've been active on Wikipedia for more than a decade now, and so far have never had the occasion to want to use this template, but for some reason, these particular sarcastic and rude remarks toward me and, further on to another editor (You will have to enlighten the Wikipedia world as to the meaning of [your comments]", "Please also note during this editing 101 class that...]] and so on, have really pushed my buttons! Any advice appreciated, thanks. --<a href="/w/index.php?title=User:IamNotU&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:IamNotU (page does not exist)">IamNotU</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:IamNotU" title="User talk:IamNotU">talk</a>) 03:11, 22 May 2018 (UTC)</p>
<dl><dd>Hello <a href="/w/index.php?title=User:IamNotU&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:IamNotU (page does not exist)">IamNotU</a> and welcome to the Teahouse.</dd>
<dd>More a violation of <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:AGF" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:AGF">AGF</a>, I think. You could graciously ignore the comment, it's an easy way to go.</dd>
<dd>The warning templates are not magic. The wording has been worked out carefully to be civil, non-antagonistic, but firm. You could post your own admonition, based on the warning template, but ommitting the "so it has been removed" phrase. But you should not remove any comments.</dd>
<dd>My reading is that <a href="/wiki/User:Otr500" title="User:Otr500">Otr500</a> was making an overly sarcastic response to your advice. I agree with them that your advice was largely incorrect. <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:EDITATAFD" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:EDITATAFD">WP:EDITATAFD</a> says that even if an article is up for AfD, one can continue to edit the article (within certain limits) and discuss improvements on its talk page. There is no need to wait for the Afd discussion to conclude. Of course, it's a also good idea to get any notability advocacy into the AfD discussion as well, so you were partially correct.</dd>
<dd>And if you watch the AfD, you'll see that it turns on rather fine points of policy; the consensus may see things Otr500's way or perhaps conclude, instead, that some aspect of <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:NGEO" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:NGEO">NGEO</a> or other argument for <b>keep</b> is more applicable.</dd>
<dd>So my strong recommendation is to leave everything alone and just use this incident as a learning experience. <b><a href="/wiki/User:Jmcgnh" title="User:Jmcgnh"><span style="color:#2eb85c">— jmcgnh</span></a><sup><small><a href="/wiki/User_talk:Jmcgnh" title="User talk:Jmcgnh"><span style="color:#0eff1a">(talk)</span></a> <a href="/wiki/Special:Contributions/jmcgnh" title="Special:Contributions/jmcgnh"><span style="color:#196633">(contribs)</span></a></small></sup></b> 06:43, 22 May 2018 (UTC)
<dl><dd><a href="/wiki/User:Jmcgnh" title="User:Jmcgnh">jmcgnh</a>, thanks for your answer. I guess they were deliberately trying to provoke me, and I guess it worked... but probably I shouldn't let it get to me. I'm still curious about the template, and why it says the comment "has been removed". I understood that you shouldn't remove other peoples' comments, so it seems odd. In the meantime I found <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:REMOVEUNCIVIL" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:REMOVEUNCIVIL">WP:REMOVEUNCIVIL</a>, which helps explain it, though not completely... I didn't suggest people shouldn't edit the article, I just meant to ask if there were additional arguments relevant to the AfD discussion, that they could go there, rather than splitting off into two separate threads and having to cross-reference each other. It didn't seem like a helpful idea to spill the AfD discussion over to the talk page while it was still active. I admit that saying "this page is about article content" is not really right. In any case, a polite correction would have been nice instead of uncivil sarcasm... I'll try to graciously ignore it, though it's maybe too late for that now, as it looks like you pinged the user who will come here and read this? I was kind of hoping to just get some advice before saying anything to them (or not)... Anyway, thanks again. --<a href="/w/index.php?title=User:IamNotU&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:IamNotU (page does not exist)">IamNotU</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:IamNotU" title="User talk:IamNotU">talk</a>) 13:12, 22 May 2018 (UTC)
<dl><dd>Hi <a href="/w/index.php?title=User:IamNotU&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:IamNotU (page does not exist)">IamNotU</a>, I do understand how you feel for being treated for what you are not accustom to as what your background would deem a behavior is not acceptable/polite in social setting. You could visit this page for information on <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:NPA" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:NPA">what constitutes personal attack</a>. Counter vandalism team members,(or any other editor), we do revert/remove the personal attack edit and placing a "npa" (no personal attack) warning template on the said editor talk page and would continue to increase the warning level if the same type of edit continues. If personal attack edit is on user page / user talk page then it is constitutes "vandalism" edit and if the attack is particularity serious and extremely derogatory such as sexual/sexual orientation harassment, trolling with profanity, legal/violent treats we could report the editor to <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:AIV" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:AIV">Administrator intervention against vandalism</a> immediately. There are some differences between what is not a civil behaviour vs personal attack. In Wikipedia, not respond to multiple requests on unexplained edits/ or not cooperative might consider not civil but editor has committed no personal attack here, and that would be the same for being condescending, patronizing, or silly name calling (such as calling editor an idiot even their behavior fits the term). I hope the above help.

Content in Wikipedia should be written in <a href="/wiki/NPOV" class="mw-redirect mw-disambig" title="NPOV">neutral point of view</a>. A peacock term is to use words show off the subject especially when adjective such as award wining is use as it has the connotation to puff up the subject in attempt to influence and appeal to an readers' emotions. Instead stating " Julianne Moore is an award wining actress', it is better to put the wording in a plain and factual manner - " Julianne Moore is an American actress and she won an Academy Award and two Golden Globes awards.

<dd><small>(<a href="/wiki/Help:Edit_conflict" title="Help:Edit conflict">edit conflict</a>)</small> Oh, we've clashed in our replies. But <a href="/wiki/User:Reiro" title="User:Reiro">Reiro</a>, here's a similar and somewhat wordier explanation I've just written for you: It's a sensible question. My interpretation of "award-winning" is that it never gives enough information, and sounds rather similar to saying they're a really great person because they've won some awards. It seems unnecessary to say it. It <i>may very occasionally</i> be ok to use that term in the lead paragraph, providing there is also a section on "Awards and honours" further down which details (with references) all the awards they have bestowed upon them. But the question you could ask is <i>"why do I need to say someone is an award-winning person when there's clearly a section on awards?"</i> A person is a politician, a musician, a sportsman, a K-pop band or a scientist, and our encyclopaedia needs to say that. Only later does the article need to say that they have won awards of one sort or another for doing what they do. Whilst the award may help make the person notable by Wikipedia's standards, we generally don't need to say it in the introductory paragraph as if it's trying to 'big them up' - i.e using award-winning in that way is just another peacock term. I haven't checked, but I would not expect an article on <a href="/wiki/Usain_Bolt" title="Usain Bolt">Usain Bolt</a> to say he is a medal-winning athlete. I'd expect the article to specify which races he won, records he broke or to list all his the honours and awards in a discrete section. I realise this is a rather wordy explanation, and I might not have answered it very well for you, but I appreciate the question and hope I've helped at least a little in your understanding. Please let me know if this make sense, or have I confused you further?

Mentioning a specific award makes that clear; "award-winning" doesn't. But if somebody actually has won an Oscar, people will more likely describe them as "Oscar-winning" rather than "award-winning". So "award-winning" covers a range that at first sight seems to go from bottom to top, but in practice probably doesn't go to the top, and so tends to inflate their achievement. --<a href="/wiki/User:ColinFine" title="User:ColinFine">ColinFine</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:ColinFine" title="User talk:ColinFine">talk</a>) 10:58, 22 May 2018 (UTC)</dd>

However, I received an email about a product called Nutrabase which uses the same colors and print type extremely similar to the Vemma product. Can anyone find out if Nurtabase is related to Vemma? I'm curious because I received the infomercial via email and am wondering if it's the same Vemma product (that got in trouble) under different packaging and a different name. Personally, I have no idea how to go about investigating something like this.</p>

What this means is that if a reader searches for or clicks a link to <a href="/wiki/W._C._Brownell" class="mw-redirect" title="W. C. Brownell">W. C.

In the future, if there are two articles that obviously are the same topic and should obviously be the same article, replace the content of one of them (usually the one with the less appropriate title or with the lesser amount of content) with: #REDIRECT: [Other page here]. Make sure that if the article you're turning into a redirect has any content that is not mentioned in the duplicate article, that you make sure to include that information in the redirect target.

<dl><dd>Good advice, and good catch.

In my view, the best way to do this is by using {{<a href="/wiki/Template:Copied" title="Template:Copied">copied</a>}}.

<p>I have been using and contributing to Wikipedia for many years, and I have found myself in a potential edit war which I want to avoid.</p>
<p>The page Dave Min is about a current candidate up for election in California. The page has been edited recently by user BrittonBurdick, a paid staffer of rival candidate Kia Hamandachy (it's easy enough to confirm this information by searching for Britton's LinkedIn page; I won't post the link to that in the interest of privacy). I believe he has also been 'sock-puppeting' on this page as anonymous user 2600:8802:2101:2fa0:71ac:614e:db16:b2b2</p>
<p>I have made some edits to this page which I have referenced on the Dave Min talk page. "the article referenced is a fabrication" documents a dispute which I feel was resolved and edited by an admin. "The editor has attributed information not found in the cited source" is self explanatory, but this user made edits to the page reverting my edits without commenting on the talk page.</p>
<p>Recently, he removed this second edit I made (Min response statement) and commented on my person talk page as if he were posting from an admin's perspective, saying "I removed the Ballotopedia article because the consensus of editors and administrators Wikipedia that it does not meet our standards of reliable sources." The article I posted referenced his employer, rival candidate Kia Hamandachy.</p>
<p>If you look at all 24 of the edits since May 11, with the exception of my 3 edits 3 minor edits, they are all by him or the referenced anonymous account. The way the page stands now these paragraphs reflect only his partisan opinion, and he has removed all referenced to his employer.</p>
<p>I'm hoping that an impartial editor might look at these changes and make appropriate changes that would reinstate my edit. Or can I confidently go ahead and reinstate my edits (which he as referred to as BLP/Vandalism)without being accused of 'edit warring'? Could a more experienced person also comment on whether some remedy such as blocking this user might be applied? <a href="/w/index.php?title=User:Gbonline&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Gbonline (page does not exist)">Gbonline</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Gbonline" title="User talk:Gbonline">talk</a>) 16:31, 22 May 2018 (UTC)</p>

It appears that you created your user page using the <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:WIZ" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:WIZ">article wizard</a>. This is designed and intended to create drafts of <b>articles</b> that is, pages intended to eventually form part of the encyclopedia proper. Such a page needs to establish the <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:N" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:N">notability</a> of the topic, using <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:CITE" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:CITE">citations</a> of <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:RS" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:RS">reliable sources</a> (See <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:42" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:42">Wikipedia's Golden Rule</a>.) To this end the wizard puts {{<a href="/wiki/Template:Userspace_draft" title="Template:Userspace draft">Userspace draft</a>}} on the pages it creates in userspace.</dd>
<dd>However, your userpage seems to have been intended, quite properly, as a <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:UP" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:UP">user page</a>, that is, a page meant to describe a person <b>as a Wikipedia editor</b>, giving some idea of the person's background, interests, and possibly his or her accomplishments and plans in editing Wikipedia. My own user page is at <a href="/wiki/User:DESiegel" title="User:DESiegel">User:DESiegel</a>, for example. User pages need not, and indeed normally should not, cite sources or attempt to establish the notability of the editor.</dd>
<dd>The matter seems to have been corrected, and should you wish to restore the short "about" passage that you removed in a recent edit to the page, you are free to do so.</dd>
<dd>I hope this explanation clarifies matters a bit. <a href="/wiki/User:DESiegel" title="User:DESiegel">DES</a> <a href="/wiki/User_talk:DESiegel" title="User talk:DESiegel"><sup>(talk)</sup></a><a href="/wiki/Special:Contributions/DESiegel" title="Special:Contributions/DESiegel"><sub>DESiegel Contribs</sub></a> 02:14, 23 May 2018 (UTC)</dd>

Secondly: Where can I find some general info about making custom lists of articles?<br>
A further idea which my permissions wouldn't allow, but a bot/admin might find useful, might be to sort pages with n watchers and subtract from n, watchers who are users who haven't been active for more than one year. Does stuff like that happen already?<br>

While personal watchlists are private (i.e. you cannot tell whether user X watches page Y) the number of page watchers can be seen via the "page information" link (for instance, as of my writing, the Main Page <a class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Main_Page&amp;action=info">has 111728 watchers</a>), though it will say "less than 30" rather than the exact number if it is low enough (which somewhat mitigates the "vandal searches for unmaintained page" effect). You even have a stat for watchers who visited recent edits but I could not easily find what this number covers exactly (that is not documented at <a href="/wiki/Help:Page_information" title="Help:Page information">Help:Page information</a>).

<p>Hello again! Thank you for taking the time to consider my question.</p>
<p>The talk pages seem strangely empty to me, with talk pages for large collaborative articles only containing one to four sections discussing something. I'm curious why this is, and nervous that my current approach to volunteering information (presenting it on the talk page) is wrong, and that I am making a whole lot of unnecessary noise or otherwise being somehow uncouth. Can you provide me a little more insight into how the talk pages are usually used, and how they are meant to be used? <a href="/wiki/User:Ignus3" title="User:Ignus3">Ignus3</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Ignus3" title="User talk:Ignus3">talk</a>) 02:59, 23 May 2018 (UTC)</p>
<dl><dd><span class="template-ping">@<a href="/wiki/User:Ignus3" title="User:Ignus3">Ignus3</a>:</span> Often, older discussions that have run their course are <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:ARCHIVE" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:ARCHIVE">archived</a> to avoid the main talk page becoming bogged down with old, stale threads. But not everything is discussed on the talk page. It <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:BOLD" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:BOLD">really is okay</a> to just go ahead and edit the article, you don't need anyone's permission first. Of course, if anyone reverts you or disagrees, <i>then</i> it's time to take things over to the talk page and figure them out. It's entirely possible that editors on some pages just collaborated through their edits, and didn't really need to have extensive discussions on the article talk page. <a href="/wiki/User:Seraphimblade" title="User:Seraphimblade">Seraphimblade</a> <small><sup><a href="/wiki/User_talk:Seraphimblade" title="User talk:Seraphimblade">Talk to me</a></sup></small> 03:07, 23 May 2018 (UTC)</dd>

<dl><dd>Well, that might be something to bring up on the talk page, but like you said, some aren't terribly active so not a lot of people might be watching them. If you don't get much that way, you can check the top of the talk page for relevant Wikiprojects that the article falls under; members there might be able to give you some advice.

The page linked to by the current message does say that, but the message doesn't. In the meantime, perhaps a clarifying comment would be a good idea.

My reaction was largely to the decline comment which read "<span class="inline-quote-talk2" style="font-style: italic; color: #008560;">The references are not in the form of footnotes. Please see <a href="/w/index.php?title=EWP:REFB&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="EWP:REFB (page does not exist)">Referencing for Beginners</a></span>". If hypothetically, a reviewer declined to accept an otherwise acceptable draft solely because it did not use footnotes, then i think that would be incorrect. The decline reason and the comment seems to imply that this might have been done or might be done. I don't believe it actually was declined solely for that reason in this case, but the creator of the draft could well read it that way, and so might other reviewers. <a href="/wiki/User:DESiegel" title="User:DESiegel">DES</a> <a href="/wiki/User_talk:DESiegel" title="User talk:DESiegel"><sup>(talk)</sup></a><a href="/wiki/Special:Contributions/DESiegel" title="Special:Contributions/DESiegel"><sub>DESiegel Contribs</sub></a> 22:11, 24 May 2018 (UTC)</dd>

<dl><dd>I think this should wind up as a separate article, in mainspace. I think it should be significantly expanded. I would have been fine with that expansion occurring while still in draft space, but i see no serious problems with accepting the draft first and expanding it later. I think that <a class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Terufumi_Sasaki&amp;diff=842528746&amp;oldid=842494442">this redirect</a> was improper. While the editor had been advised to incorporate this content into the article about the book, there was nothing mandatory about that advice, and in fact i would have disagreed with it. The draft as it then stood was a perfectly plausible draft, with multiple cited sources, about a topic with at least a reasonable chance of being notable. Redirecting in such a case is in my view unwise and improper. The draft has now been accepted, and I see no reason to move it back to draft space. <span class="template-ping">@<a href="/wiki/User:Legacypac" title="User:Legacypac">Legacypac</a>, <a href="/wiki/User:Robert_McClenon" title="User:Robert McClenon">Robert McClenon</a>, <a href="/wiki/User:Cullen328" title="User:Cullen328">Cullen328</a>, and <a href="/wiki/User:Chrissymad" title="User:Chrissymad">Chrissymad</a>:</span> <a href="/wiki/User:DESiegel" title="User:DESiegel">DES</a> <a href="/wiki/User_talk:DESiegel" title="User talk:DESiegel"><sup>(talk)</sup></a><a href="/wiki/Special:Contributions/DESiegel" title="Special:Contributions/DESiegel"><sub>DESiegel Contribs</sub></a> 22:23, 24 May 2018 (UTC) <span class="template-ping">@<a href="/wiki/User:Legacypac" title="User:Legacypac">Legacypac</a>, <a href="/wiki/User:Robert_McClenon" title="User:Robert McClenon">Robert McClenon</a>, <a href="/wiki/User:Cullen328" title="User:Cullen328">Cullen328</a>, and <a href="/wiki/User:Chrissymad" title="User:Chrissymad">Chrissymad</a>:</span> <a href="/wiki/User:DESiegel" title="User:DESiegel">DES</a> <a href="/wiki/User_talk:DESiegel" title="User talk:DESiegel"><sup>(talk)</sup></a><a href="/wiki/Special:Contributions/DESiegel" title="Special:Contributions/DESiegel"><sub>DESiegel Contribs</sub></a> 22:25, 24 May 2018 (UTC)</dd>

<p><a href="/wiki/User:Cullen328" title="User:Cullen328">User:Cullen328</a> - I don't know whether to read your comment as a direct criticism. You write: "I do not believe that AFC reviewers should decline drafts about clearly notable topics." On its case, this reads like yet another case of dumping on the reviewers, which is just another illustration of a non-charming Wikipedia culture of dumping on some other group of Wikipedia volunteers. Are you saying that I should have accepted it the first time, when I declined it as one line that could be added to the article on the book, or a later version, such as when I asked for comments here? I don't think that an AFC reviewer should decline an article that, first, clearly paases notability, and, second, verifies the notability. I will decline a draft that says that someone played on a <a href="/wiki/National_Football_League" title="National Football League">National Football League</a> (<a href="/wiki/American_football" title="American football">American football</a>) if it has no references, and will note that the guideline says that the person is notable, but that a reference must be provided. I declined the draft the first time because in its state at the time it was in my opinion not a useful addition to article space. If I should have read minds and known that the subject is considered notable, maybe we need AFC reviewers who can read minds of critics. It is very popular in Wikipedia to dump on a group of reviewers. It also isn't helpful. I also note that there wasn't agreement as to notability, and I think that asking other editors was a better idea than just guessing that other editors knew he was notable, and I think that discussing notability is better than dumping on reviewers about notability decisions that we have seen were not unanimous. <a href="/wiki/User:Robert_McClenon" title="User:Robert McClenon">Robert McClenon</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Robert_McClenon" title="User talk:Robert McClenon">talk</a>) 15:00, 24 May 2018 (UTC)</p>
<dl><dd>
<dl><dd>I believe that my comments consisted of an assessment of notability combined with a good faith comment about what sometimes happens at AfC, <a href="/wiki/User:Robert_McClenon" title="User:Robert McClenon">Robert McClenon</a>. I do not use mind reading to assess notability, but rather the standard types of Google searches that I have used thousands of times in assessing notability. <a href="/wiki/User:Cullen328" title="User:Cullen328"><b style="color:#070">Cullen</b><sup style="color:#707">328</sup></a> <a href="/wiki/User_talk:Cullen328" title="User talk:Cullen328"><span style="color:#00F"><i>Let's discuss it</i></span></a> 15:15, 24 May 2018 (UTC)
<dl><dd>
<dl><dd><a href="/wiki/User:Cullen328" title="User:Cullen328">User:Cullen328</a> - Maybe I am hypersensitive about dumping on the reviewers, but some Wikipedia volunteers are very eager to complain about other groups of Wikipedia volunteer editors whom they say don't do enough, or are not sufficiently welcoming, or are <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:BITE" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:BITE">bitey</a>, and I get tired of criticism of the hard-working NPP and AFC reviewers. I didn't think that you used mind-reading, but it did appear that you were saying that Z should have known that the subject was clearly notable, rather than having to ask here. As I said, in this case, there wasn't agreement as to whether the article was ready for mainspace, so I think that I was reasonable in asking rather than just acting. But some editors would prefer to dump first and ask questions later. <a href="/wiki/User:Robert_McClenon" title="User:Robert McClenon">Robert McClenon</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Robert_McClenon" title="User talk:Robert McClenon">talk</a>) 21:53, 24 May 2018 (UTC)
<dl><dd>I have re-read my own comments about nine times, <a href="/wiki/User:Robert_McClenon" title="User:Robert McClenon">Robert McClenon</a>, and still cannot see how I was "dumping" on reviewers. You asked for opinions on a draft and its review. I offered my opinion on the notability of the topic and offered no harsh criticisms of anyone. I simply pointed out that I believe AfC should facilitate the acceptance of drafts about notable topics. Is that controversial? <a href="/wiki/User:Cullen328" title="User:Cullen328"><b style="color:#070">Cullen</b><sup style="color:#707">328</sup></a> <a href="/wiki/User_talk:Cullen328" title="User talk:Cullen328"><span style="color:#00F"><i>Let's discuss it</i></span></a> 22:07, 24 May 2018 (UTC)
<dl><dd><a href="/wiki/User:Cullen328" title="User:Cullen328">User:Cullen328</a> - First, I did say that I was sometimes hypersensitive about dumping on the reviewers. Second, to be precise, you did say that AFC reviewers should not decline drafts on clearly notable topics. That statement is true but not constructive, because it can be read either as a general restatement of the obvious, or as a specific statement about a particular draft, and I assumed that if it wasn't about a particular draft, it wasn't necessary. I declined the draft once, when it was one sentence, and the second time, I asked for advice. So you were either referring to my first decline, or to that draft at some point in its history, or making a general statement. Maybe it was only a general statement, but, if so, why repeat what we knew? You considered the subject to be clearly notable. There was reasoned disagreement. So your statement could plausibly have been a criticism of my action in declining it the first time, and I still think that it should have been declined the first time.</dd>
<dd>Third, just to belabor the obvious, I think that AFC reviewers may reasonably decline drafts about clearly notable topics if the draft does not establish notability or is otherwise not encyclopedic. <a href="/wiki/User:Robert_McClenon" title="User:Robert McClenon">Robert McClenon</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Robert_McClenon" title="User talk:Robert McClenon">talk</a>) 01:16, 25 May 2018 (UTC)
<dl><dd><a href="/wiki/User:Robert_McClenon" title="User:Robert McClenon">Robert McClenon</a>, when you come to a place like the Teahouse to ask a question, (and you are always welcome here), please remember that this is not the AFC Reviewers Lounge, but rather a place where improving the encyclopedia is always the highest priority. Since I am not an active AFC reviewer, I am unfamiliar with your work flow. I looked at the draft in its form when you brought it here, and immediately did a notability check, as I always do in such cases. Takes about a minute. Then I gave my opinion about the notability of the topic and whether such an article belongs in the encyclopedia. If I believe that a topic is notable, then I am motivated to help get an article about that topic into the encyclopedia, and will express my opinion about notability. My opinion is not intended as a criticism of any individual or group, but rather an attempt to facilitate the process. I am sorry that you interpreted my remarks as unfair criticism. <a href="/wiki/User:Cullen328" title="User:Cullen328"><b style="color:#070">Cullen</b><sup style="color:#707">328</sup></a> <a href="/wiki/User_talk:Cullen328" title="User talk:Cullen328"><span style="color:#00F"><i>Let's discuss it</i></span></a> 04:30, 25 May 2018 (UTC)</dd>

<p>As I mentioned above, the one action that I do think was a mistake was back-door deleting the article by a redirect while it was being discussed. <a href="/wiki/User:Robert_McClenon" title="User:Robert McClenon">Robert McClenon</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Robert_McClenon" title="User talk:Robert McClenon">talk</a>) 15:00, 24 May 2018 (UTC)</p>

<dl><dd>Now that this has come up, I wanted to add a couple of observations. <a href="/wiki/User:Robert_McClenon" title="User:Robert McClenon">User:Robert McClenon</a> has frequently used the Teahouse to ask about decisions he has made at AfC review that might more suitably be asked at the <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Articles_for_creation" title="Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Articles for creation">AfC talk page</a>, where he is also a participant. As I understand it, the Teahouse is intended to be a friendly place for editors, particularly new editors, to ask questions about how to edit Wikipedia. WP has other venues for asking more advanced and more technical questions (though we do our best to answer them when they appear here). Asking questions about how to review AfC submissions and seeking additional attention to close call cases would seem to be outside the scope of the Teahouse.</dd>
<dd>The AfC project has been going through its own set of issues. One impression many people come away with is that the AfC reviewers are judging submissions more harshly than the drafts deserve; that their collective action is preventing good content from being added to the project. One common stumbling block is a draft about a possibly-notable subject but for which the submission fails to make an acceptable case, often with unsuitable referencing. We have a dilemma: chop the article to an inadequate stub that can be accepted or decline it and try to encourage, persuade, coddle, and cajole the contributor to bring the draft up to some minimal standard. My judgment is that the latter path often fails, but is better for the overall project than the former. <b><a href="/wiki/User:Jmcgnh" title="User:Jmcgnh"><span style="color:#2eb85c">— jmcgnh</span></a><sup><small><a href="/wiki/User_talk:Jmcgnh" title="User talk:Jmcgnh"><span style="color:#0eff1a">(talk)</span></a> <a href="/wiki/Special:Contributions/jmcgnh" title="Special:Contributions/jmcgnh"><span style="color:#196633">(contribs)</span></a></small></sup></b> 05:18, 25 May 2018 (UTC)</dd>

<dl><dd>Personally, I avoid linking to PDFs posted at ResearchGate. The journal in your example (see via the doi) provides the abstract for free but sells the PDF. ResearchGate allows members to post links to PDFs of articles they are authors of, but I am not sure if that negates the journals' copyrights to those articles. As long as you are sure the article supports the text it is a citation for, the doi should suffice. <a href="/wiki/User:David_notMD" title="User:David notMD">David notMD</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:David_notMD" title="User talk:David notMD">talk</a>) 16:20, 23 May 2018 (UTC)

<dl><dd>Welcome to the Teahouse, <a href="/wiki/User:ShnRvs_Unicorn_147" title="User:ShnRvs Unicorn 147">ShnRvs Unicorn 147</a>. Why should we include complete lists of Crayola colors? That seems to be indisciminate information that our readers could easily find on the Crayola website. Is the "jenny crayon collection" a reliable source? Does it have professional editorial control and an established reputation for accuracy and fact checking? I doubt it, although I am not a crayon expert.

<p>Wanting to be totally transparent here and a total newbie so I am hoping I am not doing anything wrong! I am an art historian, curator, researcher and my primary interest is photography. However I have recently been consulting with a family that wanted to know more about their mother's artwork/career as a painter. They want to know if she was any good, if there was anything “there.” They aren’t interested in selling her work or profiting from it, they are just trying to learn more about her place in the history of art, if there was any. I am being paid for the research on the individual artist and in the process I am coming across some really interesting connections between this artist and other better-known artists, galleries, arts institutions, etc. I joined Wikipedia recently and posted a couple article suggestions here: <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Requested_articles/Arts_and_entertainment/Visual_arts" title="Wikipedia:Requested articles/Arts and entertainment/Visual arts">Wikipedia:Requested articles/Arts and entertainment/Visual arts</a>. I would like to continue sharing on Wikipedia the info I am finding as part of this research so others will learn about these connections. But the more I try to read and understand the humungous number of rules and guidelines, I am realizing this might be a conflict of interest that I will be criticized for. How exactly do I deal with this, or is Wikipedia not the place for this information? The instructions on how to disclose COI or paid contributions are so complex I can’t begin to figure out how to do the right thing.

<dl><dd>Hello,  <a href="/wiki/User:A_Lambent_Eye" title="User:A Lambent Eye">A Lambent Eye</a>, and a hearty welcome to the Teahouse. Well done on completing the <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:TWA" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:TWA">Wikipedia Adventure</a> - I hope you found it worthwhile. It looks like you've already successfully found how to get userboxes to show in which languages you are competent. So, you might like to visit some of the places we have for utilising those skills. You might like to investigate <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Translation" title="Wikipedia:Translation">Wikipedia:Translation</a> and <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Intertranswiki" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Intertranswiki">Wikipedia:WikiProject Intertranswiki</a>, and maybe add your name to <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Translators_available" title="Wikipedia:Translators available">Wikipedia:Translators available</a>. You could do well to look at some of the userpages of those editors listed there. Try that of <a href="/wiki/User:Kudpung" title="User:Kudpung">User:Kudpung</a> who has a range of multilingual skills, and is one of our very experienced administrator/editors too. Pages on English Wikipedia that that have been flagged as containing foreign language elements can be found at <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Pages_needing_translation_into_English" title="Wikipedia:Pages needing translation into English">Wikipedia:Pages needing translation into English</a>.</dd>
</dl><dl><dd>However, before you dive into too enthusiastically to offer translation, might I inject a friendly word of caution, please? Because you're very new to editing Wikipedia, I would like to urge you to spend some time familiarising yourself by simply editing English Wikipedia articles first. Having done that, you would be better placed to use your enviable multilingual to greatest effect. We are now so large (with 5.6 million articles, and 33,000 currently active editors on English Wikipedia, alone) that we do need quite a suite of policies and guidelines to ensure uniform style and approach to article construction and content. It is, unfortunately, quite easy for very new editors to be bold and to rush in in all 'good faith' and to hit problems they haven't fully appreciated. This is OK, but it can be demoralising if you're not prepared for it, and especially if you can't see what red line it is that you've stepped over. So, the trick is to listen to and heed the advice/concerns of others editors. Ask questions, too. There will nearly always be a good reason for any such advice, so do heed it, and pretty you'll soon become a great contributor. The key to becoming a successful contributor is to take small steps at a time, learning the right way to edit articles as you go along, and then I can envisage your language skills being immensely useful here, and maybe on other language wikipedias, too. I've left you a welcome message with some useful links on your talk page. Of course, do come back and ask for further assistance here should you ever need it, or if you don't feel I've quite answered the questions you were asking.

<p>Hi there, I have tried to create a few articles, in which I have cited several references, in a long list at the end of the article (which was just one paragraph). I understand that this leads to "reference or citation overkill", but what other options do I have to include all the references, if the article at this point is only a few sentences long (one paragraph)?</p>

<dl><dd>1) Gather as many <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:RS" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:RS">professionally-published mainstream academic or journalistic sources</a> you can find.</dd>
<dd><b>2)</b> <i>Focus on just the ones that are not dependent upon or affiliated with the subject, but still specifically about the subject and providing in-depth coverage (not passing mentions). If you do not have at least three such sources, the subject is not yet notable and trying to write an article at this point will only fail.</i></dd>
<dd>3) <a href="/wiki/Abstract_(summary)" title="Abstract (summary)">Summarize</a> those sources from step 2, adding <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:CITE" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:CITE">citations</a> at the end of them. You'll want to do this in a program with little/no formatting, like <a href="/wiki/Microsoft_Notepad" title="Microsoft Notepad">Microsoft Notepad</a> or <a href="/wiki/Notepad%2B%2B" title="Notepad++">Notepad++</a>, and not in something like <a href="/wiki/Microsoft_Word" title="Microsoft Word">Microsoft Word</a> or <a href="/wiki/LibreOffice" title="LibreOffice">LibreOffice</a> Writer.</dd>
<dd>4) Combine overlapping summaries (without <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:SYNTH" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:SYNTH">arriving at new statements that no individual source supports</a>) where possible, repeating citations as needed.</dd>
<dd><b>5)</b> <i><a href="/wiki/Paraphrase" title="Paraphrase">Paraphrase</a> the whole thing just to be extra sure you've avoided any <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:COPYVIO" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:COPYVIO">copyright violations or plagiarism</a>.</i></dd>
<dd>6) Use the <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Article_wizard" title="Wikipedia:Article wizard">Article wizard</a> to post this draft and wait for approval.</dd>
<dd>7) Expand the article using sources you put aside in step 2 (but make sure they don't make up more than half the sources for the article, and make sure that affiliated sources don't make up more than half of that).</dd>
</dl></dd>
<dd>Notice that you don't use every source you can find, just the meatiest ones. This avoids the whole "citation overkill" issue and lets others see that the subject is <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:NOTE" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:NOTE">notable</a> right away. Sources that just mention the subject in passing are useless for establishing an article. If those are the only sources you can find, then the subject really is not notable, no matter how many articles dedicate a whole sentence to the subject.</dd>
<dd>Also, in case those deletion notices were a bit intimidating, never, <i>ever</i>, <b>ever</b>, <i><b>ever</b></i> post copyrighted text onto the site.

You might like to read <a class="external text" href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:Currency">this article</a> on Wikimedia Commons which suggests that different countries take a different view to coin copyright than others. You're in Canada, so <a class="external text" href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:Currency#Canada">this bit</a> suggests coin images are copyrighted for 50 years. (<span class="inline-quote-talk" style="font-family: Georgia, 'DejaVu Serif', serif; color: #008560;">Coins are copyrighted by the Royal Canadian Mint. There are charges for educational and commercial use, so they cannot be shown on Commons before the expiration of fifty years.</span> Whether an image of, say, these coins in your hand would be considered in the same way I am not qualified to comment upon. Commons is a lot fussier about copyright infringement than is en-wiki, so maybe uploading locally might be a sensible approach. Please take this as a personal opinion, rather than formal advice. Maybe others could offer a better perspective.

<p>Hello. A popular Korean celebrity has her own fashion brand since 2014. I added well-sourced details about her brand in her own article page under a separate heading, but it was removed due to "blatant advertising". I wanted to know why I couldn't add information about her business in her own article, but I wasn't given a reply. There are dozens of online publications and magazines which have written full articles about the fashion brand (Eg: Vogue, Kodemag, KBS, Fashionista etc) so there is no shortage of reputable sources for information/details. Why can't facts about her business be included in her Wikipedia page? If this is the case, can I create an article for the fashion brand? <a href="/wiki/User:Jesstan01" title="User:Jesstan01">Jesstan01</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Jesstan01" title="User talk:Jesstan01">talk</a>) 22:16, 23 May 2018 (UTC)</p>

<dl><dd>Hello, <a href="/wiki/User:Jesstan01" title="User:Jesstan01">Jesstan01</a>, and welcome to our Teahouse. It's great to see a BTS fan and K-pop-lover wanting to edit here. My daughter is utterly infatuated with both, and she loves to read about brands, so your edits would have interested her immensely. Unfortunately, however, by adding a very large amount of content about one brand line that the person (<a href="/wiki/Jessica_Jung" title="Jessica Jung">Jessica Jung</a>) has created, you have rather gone off at quite a tangent. This is not appropriate for an encyclopaedia page on the biography of a living person. Had you mentioned it with just one or two sentences, providing a reliable reference to a source that is independent of the subject, that might have been ok. But I hope you can appreciate that you added far too much detail, causing the biographical article to rather go off course and to lose its focus. So a reader might then wonder if this was an article about a person or their brand. Another editor who removed your edit did leave a brief but polite note in their edit summary to say that this looked too promotional, so was deleting it. And I agree with them. What I'd encourage you to do is to just write a few lines with citations and explain your suggested edit on the talk page of that article and see what others think before you add it. We work by consensus here, so asking for opinions is exactly the right way to go forward when you're not quite sure what's best. If (and it's a big 'if') the brand has attracted the attention of the media and of writers, and if you can provide references that talk about it in great depth to prove that it meets what we call our "<a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:N" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:N">Notability</a> guidelines, the brand might well merit a linked article of its own. See also <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:PRODUCT" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:PRODUCT">WP:PRODUCT</a>. (I haven't looked in detail at the information on this brand to make that assessment, I'm afraid). Does this help explain your concerns? Either way, keep up the good work!

<p>I just looked at the Page about Key Lime Pie. There are some gross inaccuracies with the pictures displayed on the page. I wouldn't presume to edit these but I wanted to bring it to someone's attention. Key Lime Pie is never served with meringue and most certainly is NEVER, EVER green. It came to the keys with workers who came over from the Bahamas and is an adaption of Bahamian Sour Orange pie.

<dl><dd>Hello, IP editor. I agree that the photos in the article are not the best, but our articles reflect what reliable sources say. I am the main writer of an article about a culinary topic <a href="/wiki/Salade_ni%C3%A7oise" title="Salade niçoise">Salade niçoise</a>, where there is great disagreement about which ingredients should be used in the dish. Wikipedia articles need to reflect both sides of a controversy, which I tried to reflect in that article. When I did a Google search for Key lime pie sources, I found an article in <i>Southern Living</i>, that describes the controversy about meringue vs whipped cream as an issue that might start a riot. There are clearly two sides rather than a single answer.There are recipes from notable chefs that include meringue, and those from other notable chefs that exclude meringue. Martha Stewart has recipes both ways. So, your statement that "Key Lime Pie is never served with meringue" is an expression of your legitimate opinion, but not a statement of fact. All that being said, the current version of the article is weak and can definitely be improved. <a href="/wiki/User:Cullen328" title="User:Cullen328"><b style="color:#070">Cullen</b><sup style="color:#707">328</sup></a> <a href="/wiki/User_talk:Cullen328" title="User talk:Cullen328"><span style="color:#00F"><i>Let's discuss it</i></span></a> 02:07, 24 May 2018 (UTC)</dd>

<dl><dd>It's common to wikilink newspaper/journal/publisher/website/author/whatever in citation templates when they have an article. The same article already did it many times.

<dl><dd>The documentation at <a href="/wiki/Template:Cite_web" title="Template:Cite web">Template:Cite web</a> says "<span class="inline-quote-talk2" style="font-style: italic; color: #008560;"><b>publisher</b>: Name of publisher; may be wikilinked if relevant.

I don't think this is a CITEVAR issue, but one of improving the metadata that anyone can and should do in any cite at any time. I don't think there is such a thing as a Wikipedia style that intentionally omits all such links, it is mrely that editors have not yet added them. If the same publi cation is cited many tiems, it is arguable that it need not be linked multiple times. <a href="/wiki/User:DESiegel" title="User:DESiegel">DES</a> <a href="/wiki/User_talk:DESiegel" title="User talk:DESiegel"><sup>(talk)</sup></a><a href="/wiki/Special:Contributions/DESiegel" title="Special:Contributions/DESiegel"><sub>DESiegel Contribs</sub></a> 14:39, 24 May 2018 (UTC)</dd>

Notability is the critical threshold which every subject with a page on this Encyclopaedia has to meet if that page is to remain here. It really means we need to know that other people, independent of the subject have deemed that thing/person/place/concept sufficiently noteworthy to have written about it in depth, be it in books, newspapers, journals etc. We don't accept evidence of noteworthiness from people associated with that person or organisation, as they're likely to have a bit of a conflict of interesting wanting to promote their favourite subject! It can get a bit complicated because different areas (films, books, software, actors, places) can have specific notability criteria written about them. This is to help people understand the bar for acceptance, and against which we seek a consensus of opinion from other editors when discussing whether a subject is notable (and should remain here), or isn't notable (and so should have its article removed). You can read a whole lot more on this subject at <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Notability" title="Wikipedia:Notability">Wikipedia:Notability</a>, and also by following other links on that page, too. I hope this helps. Oh, by the way, in future, could you remember to sign all your postes with four tildes (~~~~) which automatically adds your name and a timestamp to your messages? Thanks.

You (or maybe someone else) submitted it as an article, and it was rejected for the usual reason: "This submission's references do not adequately show the subject's notability."

<dl><dd>So, there it is, as a Draft. You have only one citation. Need others. What the subject has published has no bearing on credibility, and actually, that list should not be part of the article. Also, do you have any connection to C.I. Oreh? Family? Friend? Co-worker? Paid to create this article? This should be stated in the Talk of the Draft. Lastly, in your other edits, you are designating them as minor when they are not.

I know absolutely nothing about this subject, but that list is only for the "Knight/Dame Grand Cross (GCVO)". The comment to the edit that removed your addition said "The Duke of Sussex is only a KCVO", which would indicate he's only a "Knight/Dame Commander" and thus doesn't belong in the list.

<p>Hello all and thanks for the invite! I'm struggling with some of the policies and where to find information sometimes, but, for the most part getting around alright.</p>
<p>I do have a question about why a very very very low resolution, small, picture file was rejected from being deleted because "it's being used," but there are very-high resolution version(s) of it also on Wiki Commons. That there are high-res versions was one of the reasons I gave for deleting it. (One is a JPEG and one is a TIFF, so using the JPEG should be just fine since there can be a lower-res version preview). I got prompted to help sort images for deletion, so, it's just kind of funny/odd for that to be rejected. Am I missing something?</p>
<p>(For reference, here's what I tagged for speedy deletion: <a href="/wiki/File:Calvin_Coolidge_receiving_statue_of_Boy_Scout_outside_the_White_House_1927.jpg" title="File:Calvin Coolidge receiving statue of Boy Scout outside the White House 1927.jpg">File:Calvin Coolidge receiving statue of Boy Scout outside the White House 1927.jpg</a></p>
<p><br>
and here is a high-res version of it: <a href="/wiki/File:President_greets_visiting_boy_scouts._1500_boy_scouts_from_N.Y.,_N.J.,_%26_Conn._making_annual_pilgrimage_to_the_Capitol_being_greeted_at_the_White_House_by_President_Coolidge_LCCN94508179.jpg" title="File:President greets visiting boy scouts. 1500 boy scouts from N.Y., N.J., &amp; Conn. making annual pilgrimage to the Capitol being greeted at the White House by President Coolidge LCCN94508179.jpg">File:President greets visiting boy scouts. 1500 boy scouts from N.Y., N.J., &amp; Conn. making annual pilgrimage to the Capitol being greeted at the White House by President Coolidge LCCN94508179.jpg</a> )</p>

In principle, no one has <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:OWN" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:OWN">ownership</a> over Wikipedia content, so it does not matter where you make drafts. But in practice, as a matter of <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:ETIQUETTE" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:ETIQUETTE">etiquette</a>, people often choose not to edit others' userpages. So, you'll be more likely to see other editors improve drafts in the Draft space than in the User space. In that regard, chose whichever suits you best.</dd>
</dl><dl><dd>There is one technical difference however. All pages in the Draft space can be deleted after 6 months if no one has improved them. For drafts in User space, they will have to go through an individual deletion discussion first. If you have {{<a href="/wiki/Template:AFC_submission" title="Template:AFC submission">AFC submission</a>}} on a userpage draft, however, it can be deleted after 6 months without discussion.</dd>
</dl><dl><dd>In sum, if you are planning to have your draft ready within 6 months, it does not matter.

<p>I would like to centralize the discussion of <a href="/wiki/Draft:Kopparapu_Duo_Poets" title="Draft:Kopparapu Duo Poets">Draft:Kopparapu Duo Poets</a> here rather than on the talk pages of multiple reviewers. I reviewed this draft in a sandbox in April and declined it. At the time it was hard to tell what it was about because it did not have a well-formed <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:LEDE" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:LEDE">lede</a> and appeared to be about two people rather than about one subject. It is about two people who performed in public together. A few days ago, <a href="/w/index.php?title=User:MUMACHA2203&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:MUMACHA2203 (page does not exist)">User:MUMACHA2203</a> improved it and resubmitted it and <a href="/wiki/User:Legacypac" title="User:Legacypac">User:Legacypac</a> declined it as not showing notability, and I said that it appeared to be written to praise the subjects rather than describing them neutrally. They have an article in the <a href="/wiki/Telugu_Wikipedia" title="Telugu Wikipedia">Telugu Wikipedia</a>. I understand that each language Wikipedia has its own standards, and that inclusion in another Wikipedia is not evidence of notability, and that <a href="/wiki/Telugu_language" title="Telugu language">Telugu language</a> sources are acceptable.</p>
<p>The author has since been discussing the draft at my talk page and that of <a href="/wiki/User:Legacypac" title="User:Legacypac">User:Legacypac</a>. I have had difficulty addressing and responding to that discussion, and it appears that the author is having difficulty trying to discuss in English, but I don’t know Telugu, and English is the language for discussion in the English Wikipedia. I stated that perhaps <a href="/w/index.php?title=User:MUMACHA2203&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:MUMACHA2203 (page does not exist)">User:MUMACHA2203</a> would benefit from a co-author who is more fluent in English. (I tried to be diplomatic.) They then, evidently in good-faith error, created a second copy of the draft, and moved both drafts into article space as ready for article space. <a href="/wiki/User:Discospinster" title="User:Discospinster">User:Discospinster</a> then draftified one article as not ready for article space. <a href="/wiki/User:CambridgeBayWeather" title="User:CambridgeBayWeather">User:CambridgeBayWeather</a> then draftified the other article. I then converted one of the two drafts into a redirect to the other. One draft is now in draft space. <a href="/w/index.php?title=User:MUMACHA2203&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:MUMACHA2203 (page does not exist)">User:MUMACHA2203</a> is continuing to post to my talk page and those of Legacypac and Discospinster. They say that the poets are notable, and that other poets have articles that were written to praise them. I realize that the author wants to have his poetic heroes memorialized, but I think that further discussion on the talk pages of multiple editors is not helping.

<dl><dd>Great summary. Notwithstanding the claims of the creator I suspect the real reason this page was created was to support the release of a new book of these poems - a commercial purpose. The draft pretty much says no one paid any attention to them while they were alive or since which screams "not notable" to me. Given the AfC rejections and their decision to move it to mainspace twice, a return to mainspace for an AfD would be in order, or MfD it and push for a proper discussion on notability. <a href="/wiki/User:Legacypac" title="User:Legacypac">Legacypac</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Legacypac" title="User talk:Legacypac">talk</a>) 23:32, 24 May 2018 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I assume good faith and further suggest to both of you that an important cultural difference - besides language and Wikipedia standards - is likely at play. It is obvious from the source I found in seconds (and just added to <a href="/wiki/Draft_talk:Kopparapu_Duo_Poets#JSTOR_mention;_perhaps_more_in_pre-1920_Teluga_Encyclopaedia,_Egmore,_Madras_(K.V._Lakshmanrao,_general_editor)" title="Draft talk:Kopparapu Duo Poets">Draft Talk page</a>) that these poetic performers may have been among the last of their type, oral poets, and venerated as much as I venerate Homer.

<p>Is there agreement that if an editor has suggested that discussion about a draft article be continued in some public forum, such as here, or at the Village Pump, and has made that statement on their talk page, that it is not useful to continue to discuss on multiple user talk pages? <a href="/wiki/User:Robert_McClenon" title="User:Robert McClenon">Robert McClenon</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Robert_McClenon" title="User talk:Robert McClenon">talk</a>) 01:41, 25 May 2018 (UTC)</p>

<p><a href="/wiki/User:Legacypac" title="User:Legacypac">User:Legacypac</a> says that "a return to mainspace for an AFD would be in order". Returned or moved by whom? I think that, for a reviewer or other third-party editor, moving a page from draft space to article space in order to <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:AFD" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:AFD">nominate it for deletion</a> is a terrible idea, disrespectful of the purpose of article space, which is that article space is the outward face of Wikipedia to the readers. If you don't think that a draft belongs in article space, don't put it in article space. Don't put it in article space just to take advantage of AFD. That isn't right. If you don't think it belongs in article space, leave it somewhere else. <a href="/wiki/User:Robert_McClenon" title="User:Robert McClenon">Robert McClenon</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Robert_McClenon" title="User talk:Robert McClenon">talk</a>) 01:41, 25 May 2018 (UTC)</p>
<p>If you don't think it belongs in draft space, go ahead and <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:MFD" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:MFD">nominate it for MFD</a>, with a valid MFD rationale. Using article space just for a deletion discussion is a terrible idea. <a href="/wiki/User:Robert_McClenon" title="User:Robert McClenon">Robert McClenon</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Robert_McClenon" title="User talk:Robert McClenon">talk</a>) 01:41, 25 May 2018 (UTC)</p>
<p>Please don't take my words out of context. There are situations where a page should be retained or returned to mainspace to face AfD. As you know certian busybodies with no experience in Draft management prevent MfD from functioning to properly to deal with problematic pages. Where notability needs to be tested AfD seems to be the appropriate venue. Occasionally a page is Draftified instead of AfD'd in error. That decision should be overturnable. In a recent case Robert called a page a "fugative from justice" when the creator moved it out of AfC to mainspace than back to Draft when someone sought deletion. Frankly there are maybe several hundred thousand pages already in mainspace that deserve deletion right now and many more that are unreferemced and/or have countless other problems. I can't see much harm in an extra one sitting there unindexed (just like a Draft) for a week with an AfD tag while we figure out if it deserves to live or die and interested editors take a shot at fixing it. If the creator already placed it in mainspace what's the big harm in putting it back? Just look at all the other pages sitting in maknspace under AfD that may be found delete worthy. Why are they fine to be in mainspace while under discussion but a page that was moved to Draft is not appropriate to be put back in mainspace for proper consideration? <a href="/wiki/User:Legacypac" title="User:Legacypac">Legacypac</a> (<a href="/wiki/User_talk:Legacypac" title="User talk:Legacypac">talk</a>) 02:27, 25 May 2018 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The governing policy for this is known as <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:COMMONNAME" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:COMMONNAME">COMMONNAME</a>. WP uses the name that is predominantly used by reliable sources in discussing the subject. Official names or the desires of the subject are not determinative of what name is used on WP. If you go to <a href="/wiki/Talk:Myanmar" title="Talk:Myanmar">Talk:Myanmar</a>, you'll see that there has been considerable discussion about which name should be used for the article. At the time the <a href="/wiki/Kaing_Shwedaung" title="Kaing Shwedaung">Kaing Shwedaung</a> article was created, Burma was still the name used on WP for the country. Since there is no ambiguity about the country intended, there is no urgency to replace all uses of "Burma". You could do this now or leave things the way they are; I don't think there's a policy-based reason not to do it. <b><a href="/wiki/User:Jmcgnh" title="User:Jmcgnh"><span style="color:#2eb85c">— jmcgnh</span></a><sup><small><a href="/wiki/User_talk:Jmcgnh" title="User talk:Jmcgnh"><span style="color:#0eff1a">(talk)</span></a> <a href="/wiki/Special:Contributions/jmcgnh" title="Special:Contributions/jmcgnh"><span style="color:#196633">(contribs)</span></a></small></sup></b> 04:25, 25 May 2018 (UTC)

<p>Hi I revised big-time an article, (tripled length and references) using my <a href="/wiki/User:GeeBee60/sandbox" title="User:GeeBee60/sandbox">Sandbox</a>, and then clicked the <b>Submit</b> box. Two month wait, and I wonder if there is a different way to get a review before posting. Or should I just post it? It is competent, not a controversial proof of an alien invasion conspiracy etc., but ... Appreciate any feedback / redirects.

<dl><dd>Hello <a href="/wiki/User:GeeBee60" title="User:GeeBee60">GeeBee60</a> and welcome to the Teahouse.</dd>
<dd>I'm sure it has happened before, but this is the first time <i>I</i> have encountered someone asking for AfC review of a sandbox created as a rewrite of an existing article. Flatly, this is not what AfC review is intended to do. I looked at your sandbox but don't feel competent to give feedback on your expansion of the original article. The optimal place to find people interested in the article is on the talk page of the original article (which you kind of credited when you copied it into your sandbox, but should really have more explicitly followed <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:COPYWITHIN" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:COPYWITHIN">COPYWITHIN</a>). The next best place would be the talk page of <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Medicine" title="Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Medicine">WikiProject Medicine</a> or, if it exists, an applicable subproject of that WikiProject. If you're confident that you've done a good job on the rewrite, check for contributions by other editors in the intervening two months, make sure those changes are incorporated or addressed in your draft, and copypaste your sandbox into the content of <a href="/wiki/Monomelic_amyotrophy" title="Monomelic amyotrophy">Monomelic amyotrophy</a> (again, with attribution according to <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:COPYWITHIN" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:COPYWITHIN">COPYWITHIN</a>). This is a pretty common practice by experienced editors and the discussion can proceed from there, if anyone has objections. When someone makes a big change to an article, there is often some pushback, so you may want to post a general explanation of what you did at <a href="/wiki/Talk:Monomelic_amyotrophy" title="Talk:Monomelic amyotrophy">Talk:Monomelic amyotrophy</a> just to lay out your reasoning. <b><a href="/wiki/User:Jmcgnh" title="User:Jmcgnh"><span style="color:#2eb85c">— jmcgnh</span></a><sup><small><a href="/wiki/User_talk:Jmcgnh" title="User talk:Jmcgnh"><span style="color:#0eff1a">(talk)</span></a> <a href="/wiki/Special:Contributions/jmcgnh" title="Special:Contributions/jmcgnh"><span style="color:#196633">(contribs)</span></a></small></sup></b> 05:59, 25 May 2018 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>One of the most important considerations for accepting an article is whether the subject is <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Notable" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:Notable">notable</a>, in the Wikipedia sense of the word. In fact, there's a special set of considerations called <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:NSOFTWARE" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:NSOFTWARE">NSOFTWARE</a> that applies here. As far as I know, WP does not have a policy that says <i>every</i> Linux distribution should have its own article. And the fact that other Linux distributions <i>do</i> have an article is not, all by itself, <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:OTHERSTUFF" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:OTHERSTUFF">sufficient reason</a> for adding an article on another Linux distribution. So how do you think GeckoLinux stacks up against those criteria? Have you been able to find some in-depth coverage that is not written the project itself? Has it been written about by someone who is not best considered part of an enthusiast niche?</dd>
<dd>I think the other deficiencies of your article can easily be addressed. <b><a href="/wiki/User:Jmcgnh" title="User:Jmcgnh"><span style="color:#2eb85c">— jmcgnh</span></a><sup><small><a href="/wiki/User_talk:Jmcgnh" title="User talk:Jmcgnh"><span style="color:#0eff1a">(talk)</span></a> <a href="/wiki/Special:Contributions/jmcgnh" title="Special:Contributions/jmcgnh"><span style="color:#196633">(contribs)</span></a></small></sup></b> 06:54, 25 May 2018 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have created this draft article <a href="/wiki/Draft:Gopal_Narayan_Authey" title="Draft:Gopal Narayan Authey">Draft:Gopal Narayan Authey</a> about a Hindi writer which was recently declined for not showing adequate notability. The writer has over 60 publications in Hindi language and has received many awards for his works. However, the article is declined because of the person not having significant coverage in news, books or peer-reviewed journals. I have used references from four news sources, one magazine source, two public library catalogues, one journal and one database among other sources. I have used total 33 references. How does the significant coverage for notability is defined? I see many other Wikipedia articles having fewer references to be accepted. Please help me.

<p>Hi! :)</p>
<p>My article has recently been declined due to the lack of notability. Could anyone please help me to identify the notable sources as well as those which are not notable enough from the list I provided under my article?</p>
<p>As far as I know these are well-known sources in the markets they represent, therefore I feel confused on how to proceed further. I made a long list collecting various sources where Harba was mentioned, and selected only those which based on Wikipedia hidelines seemed notable.</p>
<p>Here is the article I was working on -&gt; <a class="external free" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft:Harba_ApS">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft:Harba_ApS</a></p>
